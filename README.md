# Lesson 1

## The history of computing and programming

### What is programming?

* Programming is the process of setting standards for the accomplishment of a task.

### What is computing?

* Computing is using preset standards to process input and give out an output.

### The history of computer and programming

* Programming existed before computer and it is all about setting standards.For example let's consider the publishers and authors.In the past authors used to submit the fonts and styles(stylesheet) plus the content of their book.This led to the creation of the Cascade Style Sheet(CSS) after the invention of computer.Computer was first created to perform simple calculations like addition,subtraction and multiplication.It was just a calculator and the word computer was devised from the word compute.

## Conclusion

* To finalise, the history of computer and programming implies that computing is all based on human activities that were done manually in the past.The computer is created to automate manual tasks. Computing is all about processing text to produce an output and store information to pass knowledge from generations to generations.
